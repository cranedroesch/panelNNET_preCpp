Semiparametric panel data models using neural networks

TBD:
1.  Implement methods for heterogeneous causal effects.  This is simply an interaction between the topmost derived variables and a treatment effect.  
2.  Write a function that calculate element-wise confidence intervals.
3.  Optimization/rewriting in low-level languages
