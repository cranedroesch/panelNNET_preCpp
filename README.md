# panelNNET
Semiparametric panel data models using neural networks

TBD:

1.  Update manpages

2.  Need a method for including groups that aren't necessarily represented by fixed effects in estimating cluster vcv

3.  Remove duplicate Jacobians inside $vc.  They waste space.

4.  Optimization/rewriting in low-level languages

5.  Implement minibatch with the optim option

6.  fix plot method for when optim is selected

6.  Look into GPU libraries

7.  Implement convolutional neural nets with weight sharing
