# panelNNET
Semiparametric panel data models using neural networks

TBD:

1.  Update manpages

2.  Need a method for including groups that aren't necessarily represented by fixed effects in estimating cluster vcv

3.  Remove duplicate Jacobians inside $vc.  They waste space.

4.  Optimization/rewriting in low-level languages

6.  Re-introduce optim option

8.  Look into GPU libraries after profiling
