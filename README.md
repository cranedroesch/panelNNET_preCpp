# panelNNET
Semiparametric panel data models using neural networks

TBD:

1.  Implement methods for heterogeneous causal effects.  This is simply an interaction between the topmost derived variables and a treatment effect.  

2.  Write a function that calculate element-wise confidence intervals.

3.  Optimization/rewriting in low-level languages

4.  cv.panelNNET throws an error when the arguments to panelNNET.est are subset.  For example X[tr,].  Fix this.
