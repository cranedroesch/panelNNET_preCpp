Semiparametric panel data models using neural networks

TBD:

1.  Implement methods for heterogeneous causal effects.  This is simply an interaction between the topmost derived variables and a treatment effect.  This has been started.  The following things need attention:
  --man pages

2.  Need a method for including groups that aren't necessarily represented by fixed effects in estimating cluster vcv

3.  Remove duplicate Jacobians inside $vc.  They waste space.

4.  Summary function should be robust to missing vc's, not just ones with error messages.

5.  Optimization/rewriting in low-level languages

6.  In cross-validation function when dealing with fixed effects, FE's are estimated off of the unpenalized model.  This will give the wrong fixed effects.  Will need to estimate them longhand rather than relying on felm and getfe from lfe
